<ul>
  <li style="color: #C8C8C8; font-size: 20px; text-align: center;"><b>Eric Arthur Blair (1903-1950)</b> - Better known by his pen name, George Orwell, Eric came from England to volunteer to defend the Spanish Republic. His experiences inspired not only a non-fiction account of his time in Spain, but the plots of his more famous fictional books as well. </li>
  <li style="color: #C8C8C8; font-size: 20px; text-align: center;"><b>Federico García Lorca (1898- 1936)</b> - a renowned Spanish poet who was assassinated by Nationalist forces at the beginning of the war. H. G. Wells, president of PEN, demanded the details of his fate, but nationalist forces denied knowledge and the topic stayed a forbidden subject in Spain until Franco’s death in 1975. His grave remains undiscovered.</li>
  <li style="color: #C8C8C8; font-size: 20px; text-align: center;"><b>Francisco Boix Campo (1920-1951)</b> - A veteran of the Spanish Civil War exiled to France. For this, he was imprisoned in the Mauthausen concentration camp. At his own risk, he preserved many photos that were used to convict criminals at the Nuremberg trial. He died in Paris from tuberculosis, a disease he likely caught while in Mauthausen.</li>
