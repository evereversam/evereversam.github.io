<p style="color: #C8C8C8; font-size: 23px; text-align: center;">Free software is about much more than the price of something. Free software is about defending the rights of users. It is about transparency in what our computers do. We all often hear in the news about how certain software may be spying on us, but little people seem to know about software alternatives that do respect users. Instead of Windows or MacOS, there is GNU/Linux. Instead of Microsoft Word, there is LibreOffice. Instead of Google Chrome, there is Firefox.</p>
