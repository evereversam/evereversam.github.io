<h1 style="color: #C8C8C8;">Sam's Website</h1>

<p style="color: #C8C8C8; font-size: 20px; text-align: center;">Hello and welcome to my page! This a little site with some things I am interested in. It mostly deals with the Spanish Civil War and Free and Open-Source Software. These are two different things, but they are both important to me. I have pages dedicated to both subjects where you can go and learn more about them. Also, I have a page with a list of resources other than me that I find useful or informative on those topics too. I hope you will enjoy visiting the site as much as I have enjoyed creating it.</p>

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p style="color: #C8C8C8; text-align: center;">My name is Samuel Glover. I am currently a student studying computer programming. I created this site to learn more about web development. I make no claim to be an expert on the site's subject matters and am mostly self-taught when it comes to history. But hopefully you might still learn something new. Feel free to contact me using the form below.</p>
